# Dependencies
- python3
- pywin32
- pycryptodome

# How to use?
**Step 1:** Git clone the repo

**Step 2:** Run the ``requirements.bat`` to easily install the packages required, there's `2` packages you need to download for this py script

**Step 3:** Run the python script ``python chrome.py``

***```Doing this will give you a logins.json file with the info```***

## What have I taken from this?
- I will never save Chrome passwords ever again through their default method. It's shit.
- I no longer use Chrome, I now use Firefox cause it seems like their methods of encryption is much better, correct me please if I am wrong on Discord @jw_uk
- It is incredibly easy to decrypt and that is a concern of mine because from my knowledge their encryption method "improved" but it appears false
